# Design Document: 8-Microphone Array Prototype

This document details the design and implementation plan for a simple 8-microphone digital array prototype. The prototype is aimed at validating beamforming and audio processing algorithms on an embedded platform (such as an NVIDIA Jetson). The design focuses on minimized complexity by using a single ADAU7118 PDM-to-TDM converter with its internal clock generation, eliminating the need for an external clock distribution network.

## 1. Overview

The 8-microphone prototype leverages digital MEMS microphones (Infineon IM73D122) and one ADAU7118 converter to digitize the microphone signals and output a synchronized TDM/I²S stream. By limiting the system to one converter and eight elements, we simplify PCB layout, reduce calibration challenges, and streamline the development of DSP routines.

### 2.2 Signal Flow

1. **Acoustic Signal Capture:**  
   Each Infineon IM73D122 microphone converts sound into a digital PDM bitstream.

2. **Digital Conversion:**  
   The ADAU7118 accepts all 8 PDM inputs, converts them into a coherent digital audio stream (TDM/I²S) using its internally generated clock, and applies initial filtering and gain adjustments.

3. **Data Acquisition:**  
   The digitized audio stream is transmitted via the TDM/I²S interface to the NVIDIA Jetson board, where further processing, including beamforming and direction finding, is performed.

4. **Configuration:**  
   An I²C control bus configures and monitors the ADAU7118 settings such as clock parameters, TDM slot assignments, and filtering options.

  • Separate regulation may be required for digital (IOVDD) and analog (DVDD) parts of the ADAU7118.
  
**Considerations & Pitfalls:**
- **Decoupling:**  
  • Place decoupling capacitors immediately adjacent to power pins of the ADAU7118 and microphones.
  • Ensure proper bypassing to reduce ripple and noise.
- **Isolation:**  
  • Maintain isolation between analog and digital supplies to reduce interference.
- **Power Sequencing:**  
  • Implement proper sequencing to avoid latch-ups or unstable startup conditions.

### 3.4 Interface to NVIDIA Jetson

**Pitfalls:**
- Shared or noisy ground planes can couple interference into sensitive analog signal paths.
- Inadequate decoupling between ground planes can degrade signal integrity.

### 4.3 Component Placement

- **Proximity:**  
  • Position the ADAU7118 as close to the microphone array as possible to minimize PDM trace lengths.
  - Position power management components near main supply input for effective decoupling.
  
**Pitfalls:**
- Overcrowded areas can lead to thermal issues and increased EMI.
- Improper layout might cause cross-talk between sensitive signals.
